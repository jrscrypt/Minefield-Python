~~~~~ We recommend using the IDE PYCHARM ~~~~

We are Brazilian and the code is all in Portuguese.

To help understand the code, first we ask how many bombs players want to play with.

After, we asked the names of the two players, player [1] and player [2].

We show the 5x5 matrix and player 1 chooses which house he wants to play in.

The choice of houses happens like this: first write the horizontal position and then vertical.

After choosing the appropriate squares, player 2 goes into action. player 2 has 10 rounds to try to hit the squares without finding bombs, for each square that player 2 hits he gets 1 point. If you hit a house with a bomb, well ... I think you explode hahaha.

At the end we ask if you want to repeat, if you want, type "s", or if you don't type "n".

Have fun, and good luck.    :)
